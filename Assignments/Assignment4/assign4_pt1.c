//A. Write a function that takes an array of ints, and the size of the array – another int. 
// It also returns a double. Call this one ‘average.’ Return a double that is the average 
// of the values in the array. Demonstrate that it works by finding the average of an array 
// with these values {78, 90, 56, 99, 88, 68, 92}

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
     
    return 0;
 }

 double average() {
    
 }
