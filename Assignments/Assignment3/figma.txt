I was introduced to Figma by one of my professors a couple of years ago.
Ever since then I have utilized Figma in all of my design processes. I 
am inspired and excited by the mission of this platform and want to be 
a part of its evergrowing progression. Figma's mission to provide accessible 
design to everyone, regardless of background aligns with the crucical reason why I 
can see myself growing within the organization.
