/*
In a main function declare an array of 1000 ints.
Fill up the array with random numbers that represent the rolls of a die. That means values from 1 to 6.
Write a loop that will count how many times each of the values appears in the array of 1000 die rolls.
Use an array of 6 elements to keep track of the counts, as opposed to 6 individual variables.
