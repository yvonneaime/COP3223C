/* Dynamic Memory Allocation */
 Need to know: How many you have and the data type

Calloc() - is a function for dynamic memory when we need
a continuous allocation for a specified  number of blocks
memory for a specific datatype.

ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size) 
    // n - is the number of elements 
    // element-size is the size of each element
