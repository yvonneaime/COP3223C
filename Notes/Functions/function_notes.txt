Function Notes

What is a Function? 
A subprogram that carries a task.

Rules:
1. Give the function what it needs to finish the task (pre-test, pre-condition)
2. Use that information so the function returns properly. (post-test, post-condition)


General syntax of a function:

return type - function name(parameters)

Formal parameters - are the ones listed in the actual definition; local variables.

Actual parameters - these are the values/ expressions that are calling/invoking the functiom 
in main so it passes that data to function to be called.
