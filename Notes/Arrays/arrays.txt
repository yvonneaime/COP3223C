Arrays

Common Mistakes when using arrays:
1. Out of bounds error: This happens when you index into an array with an invalid index 
(or an index doesn't exist). 

2. Not initializing all values of an array.

3. Trying to assign an entire array a value 
    Ex: test_scores = 7;
    Correct: int test_scores[7];

4. Not differentiating between an array index and the value stored in an array at a particular
index.
